Similarities:
	- arrayname and pointer stores the address of their respective datatype.
	- arrayname stores the address of the starting element of the array.
	- pointer stores the address of the variable which it is initialized.

Differences:
	- the address in arrayname cannot be changed whereas the address in pointer can be changed.
	- using arrayname we can traverse to other elements of an array as it is continuous 
	  allocation whereas pointer is used to store only one address at a time.
